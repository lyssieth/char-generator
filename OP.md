# Want to leave your character up to fate

I recently rolled on a bunch of charts to discover what my character was like (his interests, fears, etc) and thought I would compile the charts so anyone else wanting to randomize their character doesn't have to go as many places as I did to find them. Feel free to re-roll if it doesn't make sense.

This list includes:

- Hair Color (created by me)
- Eye Color (created by me)

- Hobbies-another one I used: <https://www.reddit.com/r/d100/comments/cai30l/lets_build_d100_interesting_hobbies_an_npc_can/>

IQ
So this is a process I made, and the limits are decided by your characters intelligence.

Characters with an 9 or below intelligence:
Roll 3d100 and take the lowest two and add them together. The minimum it can be is 65 and the max is 95.

Characters with a 10-13 intelligence
Roll 3d100 and take the top two and add them together. The minimum it can be is 85 and the max it can be is 115

Characters with a 14-17 intelligence
Roll 3d100 and take the top two and add them together. The minimum it can be is 105 and the max is 135

Characters with an 18+ intelligence
Roll 3d100 with advantage. Take the top two and them together. The minimum it can be is 125 and the max is 155.
